# educational-continuum-bot
RBE 522 Research project to design and test an educational continuum robot platform for use by future students.

The robot this project is designed for is a tendon-driven continuum robot consisting of several discs connected by a central flexible spine. The robot's mechanical structure is fully 3D printed with PLA. The robot is actuated by 3 Dynamixel motors which are controlled by an OpenRB-150 development board.

More detailed specifications for the robot can be found in the associated documentation included within the repository.
