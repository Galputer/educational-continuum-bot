# educational-continuum-bot
RBE 522 Research to design a comprehensive continuum robot oriented towards use by future students.

The robot this project is designed for is a 5 linked spherical structure with 4 gaps to linked through the spheres by string placed at three equillateral points from top to bottom.

The hole is 19.5 mm from the center and at a 45 degree angle from the peak of the "gear"
Each link rolls against the others and the end result is envisioned as a finger that is able to roll around to draw out a circle.
